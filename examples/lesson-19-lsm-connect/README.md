# Lesson 19: Security Detection and Defense using LSM

## Overview

Implement security controls using Linux Security Modules (LSM) hooks with eBPF for system hardening.

## Concepts Covered

- LSM (Linux Security Module) framework
- Security policy enforcement
- Access control decisions
- Audit logging and alerting

## Key Techniques

- LSM hook attachment with eBPF
- File access monitoring
- Process capability checking
- Real-time security policy enforcement

## Learning Objectives

- Build custom security policies
- Monitor and control system access
- Detect security anomalies
- Implement compliance requirements

## Capabilities

- File system access control
- Network connection filtering
- Process execution restrictions
- Dynamic security policy

## Resources

- [LSM Documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/security/lsm/)
